iOS-FrameEncoder
================

Uses hardware encoding to extract NALU's from a file, writing each to an RTMP stream via FLV1. This does ***not*** record audio. 

**This is no longer maintained!**

A similar example for RTSP (also, most of the original source) can be found [here] (http://www.gdcl.co.uk/2014/01/21/Video-Encoding-iOS7.html)
